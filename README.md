# Task 5: NEURAL NETWORKS – Loan Approval Prediction

A financial institution has provided a dataset containing customer information such as income, employment details, credit history, loan amount, and loan tenure.  
The target variable indicates whether the customer’s loan application was **approved (1)** or **rejected (0)**.  

Using this dataset, a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is built to predict loan approval status.

---

## **1. Data Understanding & Preprocessing**

### • Load the dataset and identify all input features and the target label (Loan_Status or equivalent).

### • Handle missing values appropriately.

### • Encode categorical variables  
(Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding based on type of feature).

---

## **2. Model Construction**

### • Build a feed-forward neural network (MLP) with appropriate hidden layers, activation functions, and an output layer for binary classification.

---

## **3. Model Training**

### • Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20).

---

## **4. Model Evaluation**

### • Evaluate using:  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

### • Plot training vs validation loss/accuracy curves.

### • Interpret whether the model is overfitting, underfitting, or performing well.
